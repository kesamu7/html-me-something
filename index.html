				<p class="della" id="bio">I was born in Guatemala City,Guatemala. My father received a request from his company in Guatemala to come work in the United States. He accepted the offer and we moved here. I became an American citizen when I was 15 years old.
				I love the United States, but I also like travelling back to Guatemala every chance I get. In August I travelled to Guatemala with my father.
				I will be sharing some pictures from that trip and will provide detail about every picture.

				<p class="paratext">We have some friends in Guatemala who own a coffee plantation. They invited us to come see the workings of the plantation. We saw how coffee is harvested and transported to coffee processing locations. As we walked through the more rural areas of the plantation we came upon a beautiful waterfall.</p>

				<p class="paratext">I was surprised to find out that Fidel Castro once live in Guatemala. A friend of ours took us to a small town where Fidel Castro hid from the Cuban government before going back to Cuba 
				to start a revolution. We met a man at this location that told us many stories about Castro, and about how he would speak of starting a revolution in Cuba someday. Unfortunately we were unable to enter the property.</p>

				<p class="paratext">My new favorite fruit in the world is lychee. I had heard of lychee before but had not attempted to taste it. 
				Some of my friends and family have had me taste lychee ice cream,which I enjoyed. However, the taste and texture of the actual lychee fruit was foreign to me.</p>

				<p class="paratext">Everytime I go to Guatemala. I make time, so that I may travel to a city named Antigua. It has a long history. It was built in the 1500's by Spanish conquistadors. It is a beautiful city with cobblestone streets and all the buildings have the typical architecture that was used in Spain during the 1500's. </p>
