				<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:25px">I was born in Guatemala City,Guatemala. My father received a request from his company in Guatemala, they were asking if he wanted 
				to come to the United States to work. He accepted the offer and we moved here. I became an American citizen when I was 15 years old.
				I love the United States, but I also like travelling back to Guatemala every chance I get. In August I travelled to Guatemala with my father.
				I will be sharing some pictures and will provide detail about every picture.

				<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:25px">We have some friends in Guatemala who own a coffee plantation. They invited us to come see the workings of the plantation. We saw how coffee is harvested and transported to coffee processing locations.</p>
				
				<h2 style="font-family:courier">Fidel Castro's old house in Guatemala.</h2>

				</figure>
				<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:25px">My father and I were surprised to find out that Fidel Castro once live in Guatemala. A friend of ours took us to a small town where Fidel Castro hid from the Cuban government before going back to Cuba to start a revolution. We met a man at this location that told us many stories about Castro, and about how he would speak of starting a revolution in Cuba someday.</p>
				
				<h2 style="font-family:courier">I love lychee!!!!</h2>
				<figure>

					<figcaption style="font-family:courier;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">I purchased some lychee fruit on a roadside fruit stand.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:25px">My new favorite fruit in the world is lychee. I had heard of lychee before but had not attempted to taste it. Some of my friends and family have had me taste lychee ice cream. I liked it, but I had no idea what lychee looked like or what it even looked like.</p>
				
				<h2 style="font-family:courier">My favorite city in the world.</h2>

				</figure>
				<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:25px">Everytime I go to Guatemala. I make time, so that I may travel to a city named Antigua. It has a long history. It was built in the 1500's by Spanish conquistadors. It is a beautiful city with cobblestone streets and all the buildings have the typical architecture that was used in Spain during the 1500's. </p>
