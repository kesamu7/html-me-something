			<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:20px;">This past August, I travelled to the country where I was born, Guatemala. I have been back many times,however this trip was
			different and special because it would be my father and only. Normally my whole family goes together.</p>

				<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:25px">I was born in Guatemala City,Guatemala. My father received a request from his company in Guatemala, they were asking if he wanted 
				to come to the United States to work. He accepted the offer and we moved here. I became an American citizen when I was 15 years old.
				I love the United States, but I also like travelling back to Guatemala every chance I get. In August I travelled to Guatemala with my father.
				I will be sharing some pictures and will provide detail about every picture.

				to start a revolution. We met a man at this location that told us many stories about Castro, and about how he would speak of starting a revolution in Cuba someday.</p>

				<p id="bot" style="font-family:courier;font-size:25px">Everytime I go to Guatemala. I make time, so that I may travel to a city named Antigua. It has a long history. It was built in the 1500's by Spanish conquistadors. It is a beautiful city with cobblestone streets and all the buildings have the typical architecture that was used in Spain during the 1500's. </p>
